<p><br />Go and me</p>
<hr />
<br>
I discovered Go when I was a student, but at that time there were only begginers like me to play with, so I did not make progress.<br><br>

A few years later, I started to study books on my own and play online on KGS. I could reach the 6k rank after a year and I tried to study Joseki 
  with the Dictionnary of basic kosekis by Yoshio Ishida. The problem is that I could not really undertand the sequences, so I got discouraged 
  and gave up for a while.<br><br>

A few years later again, during the first confinement in France in 2020, I started to regain interest in Go and started to play again online. 
  Within a year, I could reach the 3k rank on KGS <br><br>

Currently, I try to play serious games regularly at least once a day, and I study tsumegos with the Encyclopedy of Life and Death by Cho Chikun. 
  I feel I am making progress and I am amazed every day by the wonders offered by this incredible game.<br><br>
